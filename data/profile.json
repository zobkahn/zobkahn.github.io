My research informs the design of more responsible technology and tech policy by leveraging insights of people with lived expertise, alongside those of people with domain expertise (e.g., data scientists, policymaker, privacy scholars).  </p> At UC Berkeley, I am affiliated with the <a href='https://www.globalpolicy.science/'>Global Policy Lab</a>, <a href='https://cltc.berkeley.edu/program/ai-policy-hub/'>AI Policy Hub</a>, and <a href='https://afog.berkeley.edu/people'>Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group</a>. <p> <p> Prior to graduate school, I received my B.A. summa cum laude in Sociology from NYU. Advised by <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/deirdre-royster.html'>Deirdre Royster</a> and <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/ruth-horowitz.html'>Ruth Horowitz</a>, my award-winning honorâ€™s thesis explored racial inequalities in the US criminal justice system. My interest in digital tech and tech policy crystalized during my time working at a tech start-up and later at a plaintiff's employment law firm where I came to see how technology -- like laws -- could have disparate impact at scale. </p> <p><font color='#B7950B'>&#9733; I am on the academic job market (for tenure track positions and postdocs) in 2024-2025!</font></p>",
